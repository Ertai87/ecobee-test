This application takes a single parameter, which is the path to the input file on the classpath.  If the input file is
on the classpath, the application can be run from your favourite IDE by configuring a Maven job with the Main class as
Bootstrap and the -file argument as the input file, or from command line with Maven:

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.ertai87.ecobeetest.application.Bootstrap -Dexec.args="-file <filename here>"
