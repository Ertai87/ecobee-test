To build this application:

Prerequisites: JDK 8, Maven

1. Download ElasticSearch v.7.2 from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-7-2-0
2. Unzip the ElasticSearch package and run the bin/elasticsearch script (use defaults)
3. Run the application with the appropriate command line arguments (see run-instructions.txt)
4. If you get an error about a missing synonyms.txt file, simply create an empty file in the desired subdirectory of the Elasticsearch 7.2 root directory with the desired name.
Done!
